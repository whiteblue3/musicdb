This module is used to manage the Tracker Database.

The database stores the relation between two songs.
That means, whenever two songs were played after each other, the relation gets created,
or its wehight incremented.

There are two tables, one for song relations and one for artists.
The artist relation could be determined out of the song relations, so the artist relation table can be seen as cache.

Because the two tables, their data and algorithms are similar, all methods are made to work on both tables.
The parameter *target* is either ``"song"`` or ``"artist"`` and distinguish the tables.
If the documentation mentions *targetid* it either is the term *songid* or *artistid* depending on the argument of the methond.


    +----+-----------+-----------+--------+
    | id | targetida | targetidb | weight |
    +----+-----------+-----------+--------+

id:
    ID of the row

targetida / targetidb:
    IDs of the songs or artists that were played together.
    ID A is the smaller number of the two: ``xida < xidb``.
    There will not be the situation where xida and xidb have the same ID.
    It is prevented by the method creating the relation.

weight:
    Gets incremented whenever the xida/xidb relation occures.

This classes uses a global lock (using Python ``threading.RLock``) to avoid that relations change during complex operation.
For example, when removing a songs relation, the artists relation weight must be decreased.
There are multiple database accesses necessary to do so.
Meanwhile, nothing should be changed by other threads.
